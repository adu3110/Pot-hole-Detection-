# [Pot-hole-Detection](http://rpubs.com/Aditi3110/pothole_detection)-
The roads of Bengaluru are riddled with potholes. It would be beneficial to automate the process of detecting potholes, instead of manually looking for them. Drones can be used to collect images of roads. The purpose of this project is to build an algorithm for detecting whether there is a pothole on a road from the image of the road. We use a histogram based approach to detect potholes and image processing filters for building classification features.
